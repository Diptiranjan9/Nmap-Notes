# Nmap

### Why Nmap is important ?

Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful open-source tool used for network discovery, security auditing, and penetration testing. It helps identify live hosts, open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities. Security professionals, system administrators, and ethical hackers use Nmap to map networks, detect misconfigurations, and strengthen security defenses. With its flexible command-line options and scripting capabilities, Nmap is an essential tool for network `reconnaissance and cybersecurity` assessments.

In this repository, I have added basic to intermediate Nmap commands, organized by chapters. I learned Nmap from Udemy and enjoyed the course taught by `Chris Greer`. I am also including the Udemy [link](https://www.udemy.com/course/getting-started-with-nmap/?couponCode=ST11MT170325G3).
